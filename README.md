For undergraduate thesis.
We plan to make an accelerator that is able to aid a RISC-V 32-bit processor in order to do image convolutions and inference.
Target output for next semester is to be able to implement this in an FPGA and have some image input and then some database that we can take weights from their previous learning,
then generate an output inference or closest guess to what the image is.

Novelty (?) of the project is to hopefully be the first group in Microlab to do this, but also to add improvements to the father version of the project (Baguio, Oliva).
The goal is to find the best type of data movement for the image convolutions and then also create something that can convolve a certain database (maybe CIFAR-10 or CIFAR-100 or something better we can find).

I still feel like I have to learn more things in order to have a better vision of what the project should be and hopefully I can document something here.
